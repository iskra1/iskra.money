                  An excercise in transmission. Iskraism itself is a word without meaning. The Iskraist does not exist. The only thing of which Iskra can be guilty of is having given ground in the First World Protracted People&#39;s War. The old Iskraism is dying, and the new Iskraism struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.

      <p>When Julie Mehretu&rsquo;s survey exhibition came to the High Museum of Art last year, I got the chance to see the whole history of her work in the scale it was meant to be viewed. Her pieces are massive, often taking up entire walls, and there is always so much going on in a Mehretu piece. I went to the exhibit twice in one week just because of how much I liked it.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;[…] one man is king only because other men stand in relation of subjects to him. They, on the contrary imagine that they are subjects because he is king. (Capital Vol 1)&rdquo;
The commodity fetish seperates capitalism from other modes of production in so far as social relations are for the first time mediated through things, rather than people. In prior modes of production and governance such as autocracy, rulership was mandated through the divine right of kings - the myth of a blessing from a higher power.</p>

      <p>One has to know. One has to know it. One has to have knowledge. Now, to know is to know who and where, to know whose body it really is and what place it occupies—for it must stay in its place. In a safe place. Hamlet does not ask merely to whom the skull belonged (“Whose was it?” the question that Valéry quotes). He demands to know to whom the grave belongs (“Whose grave’s this, sir?</p>

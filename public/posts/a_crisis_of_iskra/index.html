    <p>Recently, an article was published to iskra.money that made me drop what I was doing to
write this. Currently, I’m working on a large piece discussing war, pornography, and
lonlieness but when I read Alex’s article it made me so baffled by its sheer incompetence
that I had to reply.</p>
<p>Alex, the point of iskraism is to be thought provoking, funny, and an open forum. Your
piece was neither thought provoking nor funny and it has made me request that the mod
team be more selective in what they publish. I mean seriously, what were you thinking?
You drop acid once and suddenly you know more than any optometrist in history? A key
thing for any thinker to remember is that nothing they will say is original or unknown, if
you can think of it someone else has as well and they have written about it. No one has
ever thought to publish something so dumb as what you did. Think about this, you are the
first person in history to be this stupid and cocky about something so painfully wrong.</p>
<p>Did you think you were funny? Did you think this injoke would get a chuckle? It didn’t!
No one is laughing! It fucking sucks, it sucking fucks, I would rather have a buffalo take
a diahrrea dump in my ear than read that again. I would rather eat every shit my
grandmother has ever shat in her lifetime and wash it down with hydrochloric acid
followed by a full course of gelatin made of the leftover juices and slosh in a public
BDSM dungeon than ever read that again. You are a disgrace to this community, your
family, your friends, and your ancestors who gave everything to survive and reproduce
just to have you shit all over their legacy by publishing this.</p>
<p>This is the crisis at the center of Iskraism: that someone in the world gave this white boy
acid and now he’s going utterly mad, raving about all the revelations his drug induced
stupidity has given him. Why are we platforming this? Is it in the same way a zoo gives a
platform to monkeys smearing blood riddled stool on the windows of their enclosure? I
am beyond baffled that anyone greenlit this! I place a curse on the heads of Alex and
Jacob that they will touch grass yet forever be just out of reach of getting bitches. Fuck.

    <p>As Jacob has rightly pointed out, when Iskraism is presented with the choice between lalangue and matheme we answer &ldquo;both is best&rdquo;. There is no clearer example of this than our ironic usage of \(A=A\).</p>
<p>If someone asks for the meaning of a word, how do we answer? \(A=A\)</p>
<p>Our usage of \(A=A\) is an example of lalangue par exellence, we can never say exactly what we mean and so instead we choose to say nothing at all because to say \(A=A\) is both blatantly tautological and devoid of informative content (as Hegel says &ldquo;cognition naively reduced to vacuity&rdquo;). However, at the same time when we say \(A=A\) we also mean something very serious. It is in this sense that is also a matheme, an attempt to transmit.</p>
<p>I will be bold and say that within this formula our entire worldview is implicit.</p>
<p>As readers of Hegel we know that the Absolute is the identity of identity and non-identity &ndash; identity is always involved in that which negates itselfÂ <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In order for \(A\) to have a determinate identity there must be a not-\(A\) (a \(B\), a \(C\) etc.) which is opposed to it. In writing the formula \(A=A\) there is now a second \(A\) which has a moment of othering to the first &ndash; allowing \(A\) to refer to itself reflexively. This is what leads Hegel to criticise Schelling, because for him Schelling&rsquo;s notion of the Absolute cannot think identity and difference. He sees it as an empty schema from which this moment of self-othering is missing hence &ldquo;all is one&rdquo; and &ldquo;the night in which all cows are black&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about identity is key to the entirety of Hegel&rsquo;s system, I would go as far as saying it is the dialectical method itself. So then why \(A=A\), rather than \(A = \neg A\) or \(A \neq A\)? We choose to say something which is misleading because we want to demonstrate that language itself is misleading, to demonstrate its circularity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as readers of Badiou we know that such a formula follows from the axiom of extensionality contrary to &ldquo;Law of Identity&rdquo; dogma which takes it as something innate to cognition.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

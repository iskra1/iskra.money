      <p>There’s hardly a need for an introduction paragraph. I could post some stock art of a pirate flag and you’d know what spurred this, assuming you haven’t just woken up from a years long coma and resisted the overpowering and righteous urge to hurl yourself through a window. The circus surrounding Johnny “Rape Her Corpse to Make Sure She’s Dead” Depp’s defamation trial aganist Amber Heard has been like asphixiation by helium, its certainly a bad thing no one seems to be handling well but a few people made funny noises because of it so most of us seem fine with it.</p>

      <p>Spinoza lays out in part 1 of ‘The Ethics’ that we are of one substance (God/nature) (1DVI). The substance then has infinite attributes, and modes upon which we are created. In this essay it will be shown what the account of endeavour is, how it relates to Adequate and Inadequate causes and finally how emotions play into both Endeavour and cause.
The account of Endeavour for Spinoza beings in Part Three of the Ethics, ‘Each thing, in so far as it is in itself, endeavours to persevere in its being.</p>

      <p>Premise 1: We ought to pursue states of human flourishing
Premise 2: Communism would evoke a state of human flourishing
Conclusion: Therefore we should pursue Communism
\(A=A\)
This simple argument is a reliable tool in a Communists toolbox. It&rsquo;s premises are basic, only one of which is usually disputed and it serves as a good oppurtunity to discuss communist theory. The most basic line of argument in favour of it is that it would end the domination of capital over man (cf Capital and other of Marx&rsquo;s books on political economy).</p>

      <p>Germany is a stagnant country. Its people are conservative (not in the political sense), backwards, slow, smug, uninformed and lethargic. The french can bring themselves to riot against a government that fucks up too much but the german will just take it, retaliating only by watching unfunny and ineffectual satire on tv, thinking that he is thereby sticking it to his politicians. The german will feel superior to the stupid american meanwhile his country is technologically stuck in the early 2000s.</p>

      <p>It has been recently propositioned to me that suicide is a radically individualist action. I will state my position quite briefly and succinctly: this concept is one imagined by slow mind, perhaps even retarded in its development, and reflects a fundamental deficit in the character of its author.
I will begin my response with the first excerpt of interest:
Suicide is a rare form of true individualism and is a real rejection of the forced seperation of one from oneself.</p>

      <p>DISCLAIMER: The views expressed here do not represent Iskraism.
Suicide is something that is often portrayed as the cowardly act of an individual who could not withstand the world or of one who simply surrendered to it. It is portrayed as an act of passivity. However I would argue that suicide can be one of the most radical and self asserting acts one can take. The suicidal individual is no more defeated than the disillusioned individual who although unhappy or angry at either the state of the world or their own personal situation persists and stays complicit even in unchanging circumstances like a worker in a factory endlessly performing the same tasks day after day with little gain even though they may suffer abuse from a boss or simply be worn down by the labor itself.</p>

      <p>Recently, an article was published to iskra.money that made me drop what I was doing to write this. Currently, I’m working on a large piece discussing war, pornography, and lonlieness but when I read Alex’s article it made me so baffled by its sheer incompetence that I had to reply.
Alex, the point of iskraism is to be thought provoking, funny, and an open forum. Your piece was neither thought provoking nor funny and it has made me request that the mod team be more selective in what they publish.</p>

      <p>The proposition It is proposed that vision can only directly percieve in 2d. The author is not proposing that humans cannot think in 3d, this would be prepostrous. The basis of this proposition is that vision constrains a 3rd variable(depth) as a function of two others(direction Euler angle), which in an \(R^3\) space would result in a \(R^2\) space, or a surface. Of course given that by virtue of movement, humans can percieve volume.</p>

      <p>As Jacob has rightly pointed out, when Iskraism is presented with the choice between lalangue and matheme we answer &ldquo;both is best&rdquo;. There is no clearer example of this than our ironic usage of \(A=A\).
If someone asks for the meaning of a word, how do we answer? \(A=A\)
Our usage of \(A=A\) is an example of lalangue par exellence, we can never say exactly what we mean and so instead we choose to say nothing at all because to say \(A=A\) is both blatantly tautological and devoid of informative content (as Hegel says &ldquo;cognition naively reduced to vacuity&rdquo;).</p>

      <p>This was originally going to be three (or four) different posts, but I realized they were all connected and this was going to work out pretty well. Each section is smaller than the last, forgive me for this but that&rsquo;s just how my point developed. A large part of this is an elucidation of sexual difference for its relevance to Iskraism. The rest is an incomplete explanation of Iskraism&rsquo;s combination of sophistry and philosophy.</p>

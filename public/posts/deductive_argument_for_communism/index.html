    <p>Premise 1: We ought to pursue states of human flourishing</p>
<p>Premise 2: Communism would evoke a state of human flourishing</p>
<p>Conclusion: Therefore we should pursue Communism</p>
<p>\(A=A\)</p>
<p>This simple argument is a reliable tool in a Communists toolbox. It&rsquo;s premises are basic, only one of which is usually disputed and it serves as a good oppurtunity to discuss communist theory. The most basic line of argument in favour of it is that it would end the domination of capital over man (cf Capital and other of Marx&rsquo;s books on political economy). Which according to Marx is one of the main forms of Capital&rsquo;s alienating power over humans, it is quite simple to argue that; as Capital is a totalitising abstraction which has captured the entire globe in it&rsquo;s wake, it restricts human freedom, creativity, coerces us into unethical workplaces and jobs leading to all kinds of political and social conflicts. Communism is according to Marx, a world free from all of this. The alienation and gap between humanity and Nature would be restored (see Marx&rsquo;s writing on soil science and Liebig) and domination of man over man economically would no longer exist. If Communism is indeed possible, we would see unprecedented levels of human development, spiritually, technologically and scietnifically if it was the dominant mode of production.</p>
